# Forecasting MTCOP Prices with Support Vector Regression (SVR) through Simulated Annealing 
This project showcased on how a metaheuristic algorithm, Simulated Annealing is implemented in Support Vector Regression (SVR) for hyperparameter optimization to forecast the next Malaysian Tapis Crude Oil (MTCO) Price.


# Project Description
Elaborated and detailed explanation can be found here [Project_Description.md](https://github.com/ArdaniahJ/Forecasting_MTCO_Prices_with_SVR_through_Simulated_Annealing/blob/0abe7659294906e45d082d7135c9d0b66342a978/Project_Description.md)

# Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from credible sources and includes historical prices of MTCO as well as other relevant economic indicators.

# Methods
1. Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm is used for the prediction
2. Simulated Annealing algorithm is used for the optimization of SVR hyperparameter
